body_class: charter
---

* Promote shared, not individual code ownership [^1]
* Fix the root cause rather than further contributing to
the rot [^2]
* Improve documentation before moving on.
* Features are not *done* util managing, deploying, monitoring and scaling are implemented.
* Software engineering is complex, so define terms and be precise. Check everyone understands before moving on.
* Don't add a new TODO without also referencing an open issue where others can discuss.
* Don't repeat a task for a third time without automating, unless you can serve an Awesome Excuse.
* Build according to the Twelve-Factor[^3] methodology.
* Fight for the users.
