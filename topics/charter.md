## Our Charter

* Fix the root cause rather than further contributing to
the rot [^1]
* Improve documentation before moving on.
* Features are not *done* util managing, deploying, monitoring and scaling are implemented.
* Software engineering is complex, so define terms and be precise. Check everyone understands before moving on.
* Don't add a new TODO without also referencing an open issue where others can discuss.
* Don't repeat a task for a third time without automating, unless you can serve an Awesome Excuse<sup>tm</sup>.
* Build according to the Twelve-Factor[^2] methodology.
* Fight for the users.
