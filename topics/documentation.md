Each project should have a README.md in the project's root folder. This should contain at a minimum:

* A brief description of the project, justifying its existence
* How to build the project
* If it is a deployable, how to run it
* If it is a library, a quickstart on how to use it
* If it has an API, a link to more detailed API documentation

### Infra Runbook

If the project is a deployable, rather than a library, it must also have an Infra Runbook. This details the production
infrastruture and x, y & z. Someone please feel free to add a good example.

### APIs

Public APIs should have an Apiary[^1] page describing how to use the API, see the echo API documentation[^2] as an
example. These documents should at a minimum include all publicly available calls, details on how to use authentication
and example response and request formats.
