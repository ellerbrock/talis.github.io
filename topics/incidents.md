This article outlines the dealing with Live incidents.  If your project is critical to the operating of the business then at some point it will generate a live incident and go through this process.  

### Incident Rota

A rota operates within the engineering team currently managed using the PagerDuty[^1] service.

### Incident Report

It is the responsibility of the receiving engineer to manage the incident.  Using a standard template the life cycle of the incident should be documented with as much information as possible.  Dates and times should be accurate and in UTC format.

### Communication

During an incident it is imperative to keep communication channels open with regular updates.  This include:

1. Comments on the Incident Report
2. Customer communications
3. Incident co-ordination (HipChat, Hangouts)
4. Email updates to stakeholders
