The illustration above shows the Reading Lists homepage for our demo tenancy,
_Broadminster University_. It features a discrete header, navigation bar, and
content area. Hand-rolled customisation on the navigation bar should be avoided:
use the branding console to set the background and text colours, and if a gradient -
or texture - is required, set this via the custom stylesheet.

The rationale behind imposing restrictions on tenancy branding is that it makes
it easier to keep tabs on components that are in active development. Being unsure
whether a planned update to a component will look correct across tenancies has
hampered efforts to refresh the RL user interface.

While we appreciate that customers may seek to make all manner of requests, we feel
that there should be resistance where a change might introduce complexity
further in the future.

By avoiding over-customisation, we can ensure that the customer experience is what
was intended, while offering a level of consistency across our applications. Additionally,
should a bug occur, it is easier to trace.
