By code style we mean the way you write your code. This can go down to the level of your personal preference for placement of open brackets (same line, new line?), whitespace (tabs or spaces?) etc, as well as the choices you make when it comes to organising your code into classes/functions/methods.

Something we are starting to play around with are code formatters that we can execute across the code in order to change it to a preferred style.
