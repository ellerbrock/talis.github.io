## About the handbook

This handbook outlines our general approach to engineering and contains everything you need to know to start shipping
code at Talis.

Specific project detail should live with specific projects - but everything should inherit and extend the principals
within this handbook.

All updates to the handbook are peer-reviewed by engineers at Talis and it represents our shared wisdom and values about
our development practices, culture, and how projects should be put together.

For advice on how to contribute, see the README.md in the project repository[^1].


#### Q. Who can update the handbook?

A. Anyone at Talis. Simply branch the repo[^1] and have at it. When you're done raise a pull request for review.

#### Q. What if I encounter code that doesn't follow the approach in this handbook?

A. Congratulations. You have a free pass to make anything you encounter work as described in the handbook. See the
[charter](/topics/charter.html) and our commitment to fixing broken windows.

#### Q. Why is the handbook public?

A. By making our approach public and transparent, we hope to promote responsible practices in our approach to
engineering.

There's nothing like a little public scrutiny and critique to make us think twice about whether we are going about
things in the correct way.
