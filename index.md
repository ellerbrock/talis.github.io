## About the handbook

This handbook outlines our general approach to engineering and contains everything you need to know to start shipping
code at Talis.

Specific project detail should live with specific projects - but everything should inherit and extend the principals
within this handbook.

All updates to the handbook are peer-reviewed by engineers at Talis and it represents our shared wisdom and values about
our development practices, culture, and how projects should be put together.

For advice on how to contribute, see the README.md in the project repository[^1].
