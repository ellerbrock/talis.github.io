## About the handbook

This handbook contains everything you need to know to start shipping code at Talis.

All updates are peer-reviewed by engineers at Talis and it represents our shared wisdom and values about our development
practices, culture, and how projects should be put together.

Specific technical advice should live with specific projects - but everything should inherit and extend the principals
within this handbook.

For advice on how to contribute, see the README.md in the project repository[^1].
