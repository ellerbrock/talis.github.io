# Engineering handbook

The engineering handbook documents our outline approach to development. See https://talis.github.io for more.

## How it works

This is a special GitHub pages repo, powered by Jekyll. The master is build automatically by GitHub and displayed at
https://talis.github.io.

If you wish to make changes, create a branch and submit a pull request.

## Contributing to the handbook

*Anyone* can contribute. This handbook is written by engineers, for engineers. However, when contributing or reviewing
the contributions of others, consider:

* Are you adding global knowledge, or is your topic specific to one or a small subset of projects?
* Are you adding accepted wisdom and practice, or just your own spin on things? Tip: A pull request widely shared usually resolves this ;-)
* Is your contribution both concise and precise?

The [rules for merging to master](https://talis.github.io/code-reviews.html) are the same as any other Talis repo.
